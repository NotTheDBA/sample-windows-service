# sample-windows-service

This is a project example I created to demonstrate the technique of having a windows service listener that 
polls a database for queued transaction records, then uploads the transaction data to a web API of a third-
party service.

The code is non-functional, but was desinged to be quickly converted to a functional implementation with
minimal effort.

This project depends on the Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Installer Projects plugin.
